D - only driver cog may write
L - after launch, any cog must have lock to read or write
Lf - any cog may change under lock, driver cog will read without lock
- - reserved, must remain 0
C - compile time constant, no cog may write
I - initialization constant set by launching cog, must remain constant after
Ia - compile time address constants, addresses are relative to the offsetAddr (so offsetAddr + userPortsTableAddr = hub address of user ports table)
U - only driver cog may set to any value, only specified user may set to zero (locks?)
s - settings that may be set by any cog without obtaining lock (if written
atomically), and which should not cause the changedFlag to be raised
